    <p><span class="font-weight-bold">3. Overview of MDAPP sale</span><br />
      MDAPP is required for proper operation and comprehensive utilization of MillionDollarDAPP (as defined in the white
      paper (the "White Paper") provided at https://milliondollardapp.com (the "Website") as of the date the Purchaser
      acquires MDAPP token).<br />
      The maximum total amount of MDAPPs to be issued is 10,000 (roughly equivalent to US $1,000,000). MDAPPSs are
      generated as Purchasers buy them and the total supply of MDAPPs will be fixed after the end of the MDAPP sale.
      No more MDAPPs will be issued after the end of the MDAPP sale, as described in the preceding paragraph. Ownership
      of MDAPP during the MDAPP token sale carries no rights express or implied. Purchases of MDAPP are non-refundable.
    </p>

    <p><span class="font-weight-bold">4. Transferability of MDAPP</span><br />
      MDAPP tokens can not be transferred until the Regular Sale is over. The Regular Sale is over once 10,000 MDAPP
      have been distributed. The Author is able to and allowed to enable transferability of all MDAPP anytime before the
      Regular Sale is over, at his sole discretion.
    </p>

    <p><span class="font-weight-bold">5. MDAPP Price</span><br />
      Purchasers in the MDAPP token sale will be allocated their MDAPP tokens in exchange for ETH at the latest rate
      determined by the Sale smart contract by calling a blockchain-external price ticker API via the service of
      Oraclize Ltd. The update interval and price ticker endpoint can be changed by the Author anytime at his sole
      discretion.<br />
      The targeted price of one MDAPP is US$100. Its Ether price is calculated by the last received exchange rate of the
      Ether/USD pair.
    </p>

    <p><span class="font-weight-bold">6. Timing of MDAPP Token Sale</span><br />
      The MDAPP pre-sale begins at the first Ethereum block mined after October 11th, 2018 00:00am UTC and ends at the
      last Ethereum block mined before October 17th, 2018 00:00am UTC.<br />
      The MDAPP regular sale begins at the first Ethereum block mined after October 18th, 2018 00:00am UTC and ends not
      before and not after 10,000 MDAPP have been distributed.
    </p>

    <p><span class="font-weight-bold">7. Difference between Pre-Sale and Regular Sale</span><br />
      MDAPP tokens purchased during the pre-sale period can be used to claim 10x10 pixel squares starting at the first
      Ethereum block mined after October 18th, 2018 00:00am UTC.<br />
      MDAPP tokens purchased during the regular sale can be used to claim 10x10 pixel squares starting at the first

    </p>

    <p><span class="font-weight-bold">11. Indemnification</span><br />
      To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, you will indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Author from
      and against all claims, demands, actions, damages, losses, costs and expenses (including attorneysâ€™ fees) that
      arise from or relate to: (i) your purchase or use of MDAPP; (ii) your responsibilities or obligations under these
      Terms; (iii) your violation of these Terms; or (iv) your violation of any rights of any other person or entity.<br />
      The Author reserves the right to exercise sole control over the defense, at your expense, of any claim subject to
      indemnification under this Section 11. This indemnity is in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other indemnities
      set forth in a written agreement between you and the Author.
    </p>

    <p><span class="font-weight-bold">12. Security</span><br />
      You are responsible for implementing reasonable measures for securing the wallet, vault or other storage mechanism
      you use to receive and hold MDAPP purchased from the Author, including any requisite private key(s) or other
      credentials necessary to access such storage mechanism(s). If your private key(s) or other access credentials are
      lost, you may lose access to your Tokens. The Author is not responsible for any losses, costs or expenses relating
      to lost access credentials.
    </p>

    <p><span class="font-weight-bold">13. Governing Law</span><br />
      The Terms and all non-contractual obligations arising in any way whatsoever out of or in connection with these
      Terms are governed by, construed, and take effect in accordance with German law.
    </p>

    <p class="text-center font-weight-bold">ANNEX A<br />MDAPP Risks</p>
    <p>By purchasing, owning, and using MDAPP, you expressly acknowledge and assume the following risks:</p>
    <p><span class="font-weight-bold">1. Risk of Losing Access to MDAPP Due to Loss of Private Key(s), Custodial Error or Purchase Error</span><br />
      A private key, or a combination of private keys, is necessary to control and dispose of MDAPP stored in your
      digital wallet or vault. Accordingly, loss of requisite private key(s) associated with your digital wallet or
      vault storing MDAPP will result in loss of such MDAPP. Moreover, any third party that gains access to such private
      key(s), including by gaining access to login credentials of a hosted wallet service you use, may be able to
      misappropriate your MDAPP. Any errors or malfunctions caused by or otherwise related to the digital wallet or
      vault you choose to receive and store MDAPP in, including your own failure to properly maintain or use such
      digital wallet or vault, may also result in the loss of your MDAPP. Additionally, your failure to follow precisely
      the procedures set forth in for buying and receiving Tokens, including, for instance, if you provide the wrong
      address for the receiving MDAPP, or provides an address that is not ERC-20 compatible, may result in the loss of your Tokens.
    </p>
    <p><span class="font-weight-bold">2. Risks Associated with the Ethereum Protocol</span><br />
      Because MDAPP and the MillionDollarDAPP application are based on the Ethereum protocol, any malfunction, breakdown or
      abandonment of the Ethereum protocol may have a material adverse effect on the application or MDAPP. Moreover,
      advances in cryptography, or technical advances such as the development of quantum computing, could present risks
      to the MDAPP and the application, including the utility of the MDAPP for obtaining services, by rendering
      ineffective the cryptographic consensus mechanism that underpins the Ethereum protocol.
    </p>
    <p><span class="font-weight-bold">3. Risk of Mining Attacks</span><br />
      As with other decentralized cryptographic tokens based on the Ethereum protocol, MDAPP are susceptible to attacks
      by miners in the course of validating MDAPP transactions on the Ethereum blockchain, including, but not limited,
      to double-spend attacks, majority mining power attacks, and selfish-mining attacks. Any successful attacks present
      a risk to the application and MDAPP, including, but not limited to, accurate execution and recording of
      transactions involving MDAPP.
    </p>
    <p><span class="font-weight-bold">4. Risk of Hacking and Security Weaknesses</span><br />
      Hackers or other malicious groups or organizations may attempt to interfere with the application or MDAPP in a
      variety of ways, including, but not limited to, malware attacks, denial of service attacks, consensus-based
      attacks, Sybil attacks, smurfing, and spoofing. Furthermore, because the application is based on open-source
      software, there is a risk that a third party may intentionally or unintentionally introduce weaknesses into the
      core infrastructure of the platform, which could negatively affect the application and MDAPP, including the
      utility of MDAPP for obtaining services.
    </p>
    <p><span class="font-weight-bold">5. Risks Associated with Markets for MDAPP</span><br />
      If secondary trading of Tokens is facilitated by third party exchanges, such exchanges may be relatively new and
      subject to little or no regulatory oversight, making them more susceptible to fraud or manipulation. Furthermore,
      to the extent that third-parties do ascribe an external exchange value to MDAPP (e.g., as denominated in a digital
      or fiat currency), such value may be extremely volatile.
    </p>
    <p><span class="font-weight-bold">6. Risk of Uninsured Losses</span><br />
      Unlike bank accounts or accounts at some other financial institutions, MDAPP are uninsured unless you specifically
      obtain private insurance to insure them. Thus, in the event of loss or loss of utility value, there is no public
      insurer or private insurance arranged by Author, to offer recourse to you.
    </p>
    <p><span class="font-weight-bold">7. Risks Associated with Uncertain Regulations and Enforcement Actions</span><br />
      The regulatory status of MDAPP and distributed ledger technology is unclear or unsettled in many jurisdictions.
      It is difficult to predict how or whether regulatory agencies may apply existing regulation with respect to such
      technology and its applications, including the MillionDollarDAPP application and MDAPP. It is likewise difficult
      to predict how or whether legislatures or regulatory agencies may implement changes to law and regulation
      affecting distributed ledger technology and its applications, including the platform and MDAPP. Regulatory actions
      could negatively impact the application and MDAPP in various ways, including, for purposes of illustration only,
      through a determination that the purchase, sale and delivery of MDAPP constitutes unlawful activity or that MDAPP
      are a regulated instrument that require registration or licensing of those instruments or some or all of the
      parties involved in the purchase, sale and delivery thereof. The Author may cease operations in a jurisdiction in
      the event that regulatory actions, or changes to law or regulation, make it illegal to operate in such
      jurisdiction, or undesirable to obtain the necessary regulatory approval(s) to operate in such jurisdiction.
    </p>
    <p><span class="font-weight-bold">8. Risks Arising from Taxation</span><br />
      The tax characterization of MDAPP is uncertain. You must seek your own tax advice in connection with purchasing
      MDAPP, which may result in adverse tax consequences to you, including withholding taxes, income taxes and tax
      reporting requirements.
    </p>
    <p><span class="font-weight-bold">9. Risks Arising from Lack of Governance Rights</span><br />
      Because MDAPP confer no governance rights of any kind with respect to the MillionDollarDAPP application, all
      decisions involving the application's services will be made by the Author at its sole discretion. These decisions
      could adversely affect the application and the utility of any MDAPP you own, including their utility for obtaining services.
    </p>
    <p><span class="font-weight-bold">10. Unanticipated Risks</span><br />
      Cryptographic tokens such as MDAPP are a new and untested technology. In addition to the risks included in this
      Annex A of these Terms, there are other risks associated with your purchase, possession and use of MDAPP,
      including unanticipated risks. Such risks may further materialize as unanticipated variations or combinations of
      the risks discussed in this Annex A of these Terms.
