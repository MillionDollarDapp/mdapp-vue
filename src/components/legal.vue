    <h1>Legal Disclosure</h1>
    <h4>Responsible for this website in accordance with § 5 TMG:</h4>
    <p>Patrick Stürmlinger<br />Rahel-Straus-Str. 12<br />76137 Karlsruhe</p>

    <h1 class="mt-5">Disclaimer</h1>
    <h4>Accountability for content</h4>
    <p>The contents of this site have been created with the greatest care. However, I cannot guarantee the correctness and
      completeness of the contents. According to the legal regulations I am only responsible for my own contents on this
      website. In this context I point out that I am not obliged to monitor the transmitted or stored information of
      third parties or to investigate the circumstances of illegal activities. My obligation to remove or block
      information remains unaffected by this under generally applicable laws as per §§ 8 to 10 of the Telemedia Act
      (TMG).</p>

    <h4>Accountability for links</h4>
    <p>The responsibility for the contents of external links (to websites of third parties) lies solely with the
      operators of the linked pages. At the time of linking I was not aware of any violation of the law. Should I become
      aware of a violation of the law, I will remove the corresponding link immediately.</p>

    <h4>Accountability for Blockchain hosted content</h4>
    <p>The contents (links, descriptions, contact data, image references) of the pixel area with the size of 1250x800 pixel are
      not delivered by the operator of this site. The visitor's browser connects itself to the Ethereum Blockchain and
      gets the content from there.<br />
      It is technically impossible that any party can remove or change the contents after they're stored in the Blockchain.
      The owner of the private key of the Ethereum address given under "Owner" (see the tooltip when you mouseover a
      content) is solely responsible for the setting of the content. The identities of these persons are not known to
      the site operator and cannot be determined by him.<br />
      Should the site operator become aware of legal violations, he will mark the corresponding content as "NSFW". As a
      consequence, the content will be hidden by overlaying it with a black area, as long as the site visitor does not
      explicitly request the display of "NSFW" content by pressing a button.</p>

    <h4>Copyright</h4>
    <p>Our web pages and their contents are subject to German copyright law. You are free to use the logo and extracts from
    texts for the purpose of public documentation and/or reporting and/or dissemination of this website, provided that
